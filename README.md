#My-fed-learning
## What it does
It allows you to choose models being used in your app & update the model  and send it back with weights instead of letting machine learning models have access to your data directly
By model, I mean recommendation algorithms and that sort of stuff.
Recently Twitter made their algorithm public.
My idea is that rather than having a single algorithm that may cause polarization why not enable the users
to choose the algorithms by themselves
